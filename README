########
OVERVIEW
########
This tool is specifically designed for the game Gunslinger [https://github.com/
El-Rico/Gunslinger], without Gunslinger this tool is useless, without this
tool, well, Gunslinger wouldn't have any levels.

#######
BUILDING
########
Dependencies:
OpenGL
Qt

Build procedure:
Change into the Source directory

$ cd ~/GunslingerEd/Source

Run qmake with the configuration you need

$ qmake CONFIG+=Release

Where CONFIG can be either Release, Debug, or Profile.  Release is recommended
as it will be the most stable build to run.  You may use the -o flag to specify
an alternate Makefile name, such as:

$ qmake CONFIG+=Release -o MyMakefile

Using the generated Makefile, run:

$ make

If you named the Makefile anything other than Makefile, you will need to add
the -f flag followed by the Makefile, for example:

$ make -f MyMakefile

The executables are stored in the Bin directory
