OVERVIEW
########
This tool is specifically designed for the game Gunslinger [https://github.com/
El-Rico/Gunslinger], without Gunslinger this tool is useless, without this
tool, well, Gunslinger wouldn't have any levels.

#######
BUILDING
########
Dependencies:
ZED
Xlib
OpenGL

Build procedure:
Change directory to the Source/<platform> you require

$ cd ~/GunslingerEd/Source/Linux

Run make

$ make

By default, the debug version is built and stored in:
Bin/<platform>/<arch>/<bitsize>

There are three targets available; debug [the default], release, and profile.
It is best to use the release build as that will be the most stable.

$ make release

You may run the program from the Bin/<platform>/<arch>/<bitsize> directory,
such as:

$ cd ~/GunslingerEd/Bin/Linux/x86/64/Gunslinger_<GCC version>

The version of the compiler you used to create the executable will be present,
unless you specify COMPILER_TAG=none when building

$ make release COMPILER_TAG=none
